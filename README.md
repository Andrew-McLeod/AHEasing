#AHEasing
A supplemental library of easing functions for C, C++, and Objective-C

The useful portion of this projects consists of two parts:
	* An easing function library
	* CAAnimation category methods to more easily use easing in your Core Animation projects

The following types of easing functions are planned to be supported:
	* Linear
	* Quadratic
	* Cubic
	* Quartic
	* Quintic
	* Sine
	* Circular
	* Elastic (in progress)
	* Bounce (NYI)
	* Back (NYI)
	
The design goals of AHEasing are:
	* To be as fast as conceivably possible while maintianing human readability
	* To be portable to any system with a C runtime
	* To elucidate the mathematical underpinnings of common easing functions
